# SQL-Challenge

This challenge was pretty eye opening to the posibilities with SQL. Since we've been finished with our project, it's been nice to have a break from straight python, and even more interesting learing a program specificaly for Data Analysis. After the first day of using SQL I was kind of frustruatewd, just because we couldn't use this for out prior project. Either way, I barely needed any outside help for the questions. The only roadblocks I really ran into came from the schema, but thankfull after looking at the prior zooms and taking a quick look at stack overflow I found the solution. The queries weren't terrible either, the only thing that threw me for a bit were the "B%" used to find last names that start with the letter "B". Either way, not a terrible challenge after taking a bit of a break.
